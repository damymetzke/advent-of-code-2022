# Advent Of Code solutions 2022

These are my solutions for the problems of Advent Of Code 2022.
I decided I wanted to try my hand at go, so this is the first go code I've written.

## Run

I'm not experienced in go building/packaging/etc, so my approach may be dumb.
To build the project run:

```bash
make
```

This will build all days and put them in `bin/`.
Now simply run the day you want.
I put my personal input all in the `input/` folder.
This is where the actual input is read from in the code.
